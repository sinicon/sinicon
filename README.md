### Java Developer
I started learn Java when I was 15 y.o. Most of mine biggest projects was written on Java (about 10) because It's my favorite programming language.

### Road to Programming
One of the first programming language what I met, was Java. It was really fun expirience because my father put me on chair and open Java SE Download page and say to me: "Programming!", I don't understand what he want from me and just forget about it.
About 1 year later, I started to see something magic and intresting in programming. 
My road was: **HTML+CSS->PHP->JavaScript->Java. Thats's how I come to programming.**
I have some intresting projects what I made that you can see in a close future in my GitHub, namely: Discord Bot, Parsers, Plugins, Arduino projects and etc.
